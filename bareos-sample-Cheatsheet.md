# eb8's BareOS install Cheatsheet

This is based on an armbian based Openmediavault Installation, but should work on any Debian Stretch or newer.

## Prerequisites  
Minimum Setup for OMV:  
1) Change WEB-Admin Password  
2) Enable NTP  
3) Setup Hostname & Domain  
4) Setup Network-Interface  
5) Setup eMail-Notifications in OMV: the install script sends the installation Protocol & a tarball of /etc/bareos upon completion.
6) Create a Backup-Partiton on the RAID/Disk with label **backup** and mount it.  
7) Enable SSH root login.  
8) SSH to the server as root and run ./run-once.sh (on Armbian/OMV only).
